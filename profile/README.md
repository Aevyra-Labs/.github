# Aevyra Labs

**We build practical AI solutions for real businesses.**

Aevyra Labs is a small, senior team focused on turning AI into outcomes—automation that saves time, models that inform decisions, and products that ship.

## What we do
- **Applied AI & automation** — streamline ops, reduce manual work, improve speed and quality.  
- **Decision support** — ML systems that surface signals, forecasts, and trade-offs.  
- **AI products & integrations** — from prototypes to production, across data and APIs.

## How we work
- **Small teams, fast loops** — short cycles, clear deliverables, measurable impact.  
- **Build with, not for** — we work alongside stakeholders and hand over maintainable systems.  
- **Production-minded** — security, reliability, and cost control from day one.

## Engagements
- **Discovery & pilots** — validate value quickly.  
- **Delivery sprints** — focused build cycles.  
- **Long-term support** — maintain, improve, and scale.

## Principles
- **Clarity over hype** — plain language, honest scope, realistic timelines.  
- **Privacy & security** — data minimization and least-privilege by default.  
- **Ownership** — you keep your IP; we document and transfer knowledge.

## Tech (tool-agnostic)
We use mainstream stacks (Python/TypeScript), modern ML frameworks, vector/search systems, and cloud platforms—always chosen to fit the problem and your environment.
